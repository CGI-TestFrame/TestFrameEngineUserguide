## Introduction

This chapter gives an overview of  the syntax and semantics of TFL - the TestFrame Language. TFL is a language in which tests designed via the TestFrame methodology can be written. So TestFrame is the method and TFL is the notation system for this method. For tests to be processed correctly by the Engine, they have to be written in TFL. Files containing tests written in TFL will be referred to as TestFrame clusters or test clusters or simply clusters. In this chapter about TFL it will be explained how to write clusters.

### File format of clusters

The TestFrame Engine expects clusters to be written in a specified format - a tab delimited text file. In this format the file is divided into lines, separated from each other by a newline character. Each line in its turn is divided into units referred to as columns or arguments - separated by tabs.
	
One can of course use all types of programs to create tab delimited text files - spreadsheet programs or professional text editors.
